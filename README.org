* Brainstorming
** compiler
  Could provide a node-based compiler that compiles the template to
  static HTML as well as the JS.
** Tagless
   Want a type-checked way of writing expressions, but don't have
   GADTs

   Been told that Oleg has a paper on "tagless" that helps with this

   in tagless could take a type param for the constructor/foundation
   datatype, using a ref you must provide a function foundation -> a
   to get to a Expr a
** Lightweight expression paths
   foo.bar.baz

   could do something like
   newtype Property a b = Property (a -> b)
   In es6, could use proxy to infer the property name from this
   object a-la method_missing.
** Compile-time/render time
   compile time may need to run with --harmony_proxy
   compile time takes the PolymerElement and produces a String or
   Markup

   render-time takes the PolymerElement and exports a constructor (an Eff)
